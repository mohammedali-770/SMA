-- ============================================================================
-- Loyalty v2, step 1 — PICKUP ONLY.
--
-- WHAT THE OWNER ASKED FOR
-- "I want only pick-up orders to get points and use points only in pick-up
-- orders." Both halves: a delivery order neither EARNS nor may REDEEM.
--
-- WHY THIS IS A SMALLER CHANGE THAN IT SOUNDS, measured before writing it.
-- Of 8 654 points ever earned, delivery accounts for 1 364 (~16%), and delivery
-- has been redeemed against exactly ZERO times against pickup's 1 923. So the
-- rule removes a sixth of earning and none of the redemption behaviour anyone
-- actually has.
--
-- A SETTING, NOT A HARD-CODED RULE. `app_settings.loyalty_pickup_only` defaults
-- TRUE, which is the owner's decision as of 2026-09-07. It is a setting because
-- the alternative is a migration and a §5 approval every time the business wants
-- to test the other shape -- and the closest Saudi analogue, KUDU, runs the
-- softer version (20 pts/SAR pickup vs 10 delivery) rather than excluding
-- delivery outright. Turning this off restores the previous behaviour exactly.
--
-- THE GATE IS DERIVED ONCE PER FUNCTION AND USED TWICE. `v_loyalty_channel_ok`
-- is computed immediately after `loyalty_enabled` is read, then applied to both
-- the redeem branch and the earn branch. Two independent tests of
-- `p_order_type` would be two things to keep in step; this is one.
--
-- BOTH FUNCTIONS MOVE TOGETHER, AND THAT IS THE POINT.
-- `place_order` is authoritative and `compute_order_snapshot` is the checkout
-- preview. They mirror each other line for line, and if only one gained the gate
-- the customer would be shown points the order will not grant -- the checkout
-- lying about the price. This file therefore derives BOTH bodies from
-- 20260826100000_comp_order_totals.sql by line span and applies the identical
-- anchored substitution to each; every anchor was asserted to occur exactly
-- twice before substituting. Nothing was retyped.
--
-- MONEY PATH: THE HASHES CHANGE, DELIBERATELY.
-- Every ledger row to date records `place_order` and `compute_order_snapshot`
-- hashing unchanged, and that has been used as a safety signal. This migration
-- redefines both. Record the new hashes rather than reporting a surprise.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT TOUCHED: the earn RATE, the redemption rate, the minimum, the
-- comp path, coupons, VAT, delivery fees, or any existing order. A delivery
-- order simply computes 0 earned and 0 redeemed instead of a number.
--
-- KNOWN AND DELIBERATE: points still accrue on the delivery fee and on VAT
-- (`v_points_earned := floor(v_total * v_per_riyal)` where v_total is the
-- VAT-inclusive payable). With pickup-only earning the delivery fee is always 0
-- on an earning order, so half of that is now moot; narrowing the base to the
-- merchandise subtotal is step 2's business, not a change to smuggle in here.
--
-- EVIDENCE AND OPERATION: docs/LOYALTY.md §2 (why, what it costs, how an admin
-- turns it off). Coverage: supabase/tests/loyalty_pickup_only_test.sql, whose
-- section 4 compares the preview against the placed order on BOTH channels --
-- the assertion the mirror hazard above exists for.
