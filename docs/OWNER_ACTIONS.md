# Owner Actions — Current Decision Register

> **Updated 2026-08-12.** This file lists work that cannot be completed safely from repository source alone because it needs an owner decision, a live-dashboard check, business/legal input, spending approval, or an explicitly approved production action.

Historical solved items remain available in Git/PR history; they are not repeated here as if they were still open.

## How to read this file

- **SOURCE CONFIRMED** — the repository itself establishes the current state.
- **LIVE VERIFY** — source cannot prove the current dashboard/production setting; check it before relying on it.
- **OWNER DECISION** — engineering cannot choose the business/policy answer.
- **RELEASE GATE** — must be completed before a specific release/submission, but does not necessarily block ordinary source work.

## 1. Native Build 5 physical-device validation

**Status:** RELEASE GATE — deferred, not cancelled.

PR #200 merged the audited next-build source into `claude/project-build-ie4b56` after source-level gates including TypeScript, unit tests, design-system checks, Expo checks, web export/build and Vercel validation.

What remains is the native/device proof:

- create the next approved preview/production EAS build as appropriate;
- install it on a physical device;
- validate cold launch, authentication, order-type gate, catalog/menu, cart, profile, maps/location, order history/receipt and the native-only configuration paths;
- perform any approved end-to-end order test under the release checklist;
- record the build ID/version and result.

**Starting an EAS/store build requires explicit owner approval.**

Source references: `README_MOBILE.md`, `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/BRANCH_FEATURE_RETENTION_AUDIT.md`.

## 2. Final payment-provider decision

**Status:** OWNER DECISION — blocking all new payment/refund work.

The final payment gateway has not been selected. Existing Tap/payment/refund source remains provisional and frozen; older Geidea scaffold code also remains in the server tree.

Until the decision is made:

- do not build new payment/refund behavior;
- do not change provider configuration;
- do not deploy/test payment/refund functions as ordinary development work;
- keep automated refund processing disabled;
- do not treat Tap or Geidea as the final architecture in documentation.

When a provider is selected, reopen the area through a separate reviewed plan that addresses provider verification, idempotency/reconciliation, ambiguous refund outcomes and migration/deployment order.

Authoritative decision: `docs/PAYMENT_POSTPONEMENT.md`.

## 3. Backup / PITR / restore capability

**Status:** LIVE VERIFY + OWNER DECISION — still unverified in repository evidence.

The repository does not establish:

- whether Supabase PITR is enabled;
- the actual retention window;
- whether daily/off-platform backups exist;
- who can execute a restore;
- a measured RPO/RTO;
- whether a restore drill has ever succeeded.

Required owner action:

1. Open Supabase backup settings and record the actual current configuration in `docs/BACKUP_RECOVERY.md`.
2. Decide acceptable RPO/RTO.
3. Run the documented restore drill against a disposable project.
4. Record the measured result.

Do not call backup/recovery "ready" until that file contains live evidence.

## 4. Payment-refund worker safety after any environment rebuild

**Status:** LIVE VERIFY when environments are rebuilt/restored.

The source migration chain contains the historical refund scheduler, while the product decision requires automated refund processing to remain disabled.

After any production restore/rebuild/migration replay, verify the live cron state before allowing traffic:

```sql
select jobname, active
from cron.job
where jobname = 'payment-refund-worker';
```

Expected while the payment freeze is active: `active = false`.

A restore/runbook must never assume the manual disabled state is reproduced automatically.

## 5. GitHub merge-quality enforcement

**Status:** LIVE VERIFY / SETTINGS.

Source defines the CI checks, but source alone cannot prove which repository rules are currently required in GitHub Settings.

Before relying on server-side enforcement, verify the default-branch ruleset requires the intended check-run contexts:

- `design-system`
- `Production build (Vite + Expo web export)`
- `Edge Function typecheck (Deno)`
- `Dependency audit (high+)`
- `SQL suites gate`

Do **not** require `Migration chain + SQL suites`; that heavy job is path-gated and does not report on every PR.

Also verify review-thread resolution / pull-request / linear-history rules remain enabled as intended.

If GitHub settings differ from this list, update `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` in the same change so source documentation does not claim a control that is absent.

## 6. Production deployment gating

**Status:** LIVE VERIFY / SETTINGS.

The repository contains a controlled deploy path, but whether Vercel auto-deploy is still enabled and whether the gated deploy variables/secrets are configured is a dashboard fact.

If the goal is "only deploy after all CI gates succeed":

1. verify the current Vercel Git/Production deployment behavior;
2. verify the repository's gated-deploy workflow and required check names against the current workflow files;
3. only then change Vercel auto-deploy / deploy-gate variables in the documented order;
4. trial the gated path before depending on it for production.

Any Vercel production-setting change requires explicit owner approval.

## 7. External outage monitoring and incident contacts

**Status:** OWNER DECISION / LIVE VERIFY.

Internal Operations Health runs inside the same system it observes; it is not an independent outage detector.

Decide and document:

- independent external monitoring provider;
- Supabase data-path probe;
- Vercel/site liveness/staleness probe;
- primary and secondary incident contacts;
- notification channel for critical incidents;
- what responders are allowed to do if the owner is unreachable.

Record the final answer in `docs/INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md` and keep contact information operationally usable without committing private secrets unnecessarily.

## 8. Discounts and campaigns product policy

**Status:** OWNER DECISION.

The discount/campaign foundation exists, but checkout/order behavior must not be wired from assumptions.

Resolve the business questions in `docs/DISCOUNTS_CAMPAIGNS.md` before activating campaign effects on order totals, including eligibility/stacking/priorities and operational ownership.

## 9. Store-submission readiness re-check

**Status:** RELEASE GATE — re-verify before App Store / Play submission.

Earlier readiness audits identified legal/reviewer/store-metadata gaps. Those observations were point-in-time findings and must not be copied forward as current without checking the live app/site and store consoles.

Before submission verify, at minimum:

- public privacy-policy URL;
- Terms / refund / delete-account/support pages match shipped behavior;
- in-app account deletion and public policy do not contradict each other;
- reviewer login/test path is usable without exposing production credentials;
- app metadata, screenshots and support contact are current;
- iOS/Android identifiers, versions and signing credentials are correct;
- native build has completed the physical-device gate.

If legal text is still placeholder/incomplete, separate factual product corrections from wording that requires counsel.

## 10. Push notifications

**Status:** SOURCE CONFIRMED — intentionally dormant; no action unless product decision changes.

Push code exists but is not an active customer channel by design. Do not add credentials, native push entitlement, enable the integration or start sending notifications without a separate owner decision and rollout plan.

## 11. Sentry production source maps

**Status:** SOURCE/RELEASE HISTORY updated.

The August 11 iOS release-readiness work added `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` to the EAS production environment and aligned the Sentry React Native compatibility line. Do not reintroduce the old documentation claim that the token is simply missing.

For each production release, verify source-map upload through the current Sentry release gates rather than assuming a historical secret still exists/works.

## 12. Migration ledger live reconciliation

**Status:** LIVE VERIFY — documentation debt discovered 2026-08-12.

`docs/MIGRATIONS.md` was last fully reconciled against Production on 2026-08-07. It records **68 repository migrations / 70 live history rows** as that dated snapshot.

After that snapshot, the Aug 10 production-readiness PRs added **10 new repository migration files**, bringing the current repository migration-file count to **78**:

- `20260810100000_order_status_cancellation_integrity.sql`
- `20260810100500_coupon_code_identity_guard.sql`
- `20260810113000_order_integrity_stranded_orders_health.sql`
- `20260810113500_stranded_order_alert_and_index.sql`
- `20260810120000_account_deletion_manual_review_resolution.sql`
- `20260810130000_security_performance_hardening.sql`
- `20260810132000_order_modifier_contract.sql`
- `20260810140000_staff_role_administration.sql`
- `20260810141000_staff_access_directory.sql`
- `20260810142000_staff_mfa_aal2.sql`
- `20260810143000_remove_anon_role_helper_rpcs.sql`

**Correction:** the list above contains 11 filenames, not 10; PR #183 added two and the later hardening sequence added nine. Therefore the current repository count is **79**, not 78. This arithmetic must be verified against the actual `supabase/migrations/` directory during the live reconciliation; do not use either number as a production-history claim until counted directly.

The key point is independent of the exact repository count: the Aug 7 `Unapplied repository files: 0` statement is no longer a current production claim.

Required next reconciliation:

1. count current repository migration files directly;
2. read live `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` rows;
3. map by migration name/content, not filename timestamp;
4. classify repository-only/live-only/history-divergent rows;
5. update the header and classification algebra in `docs/MIGRATIONS.md`;
6. do **not** apply/repair anything merely to make counts match.

This is a read-only audit until a specific unapplied migration is proven and separately approved for application.

## Owner-action closeout rule

When an item is completed:

1. update the owning operational document with the verified result;
2. remove or mark the item resolved here;
3. include the verification date and evidence source;
4. avoid leaving "currently" statements that depend on an old dashboard snapshot.

This file is a current decision register, not an incident diary.
